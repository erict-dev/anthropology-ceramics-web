Founded by Christina and Eric, Olomana Studios is a haven where art, nature, and tranquility converge. Christina's journey into ceramics has taken her from Laguna Beach to the pottery villages of Mashiko and Shigaraki in Japan, and Jingdezhen in China, where she apprenticed under master ceramicists Hozan Tanii, Tomoko Yamato, and Changcai Zhang. She draws inspiration from her time living in Japan’s mountains, crafting functional pieces that embody simplicity and interconnectedness."}

                  {"At Olomana Studios, our philosophy is deeply intertwined with our personal journeys and the timeless traditions of ceramics. We believe that art is not just a form of expression, but a way of connecting with the world and with each other. Our work is a reflection of the places we’ve been, the cultures we’ve experienced, and the beauty we see in everyday life. Embracing the ancient techniques of pottery from Japan and China, we infuse our creations with a sense of tradition and authenticity, focusing on the process as much as the final product. Each piece we craft tells a story, evokes emotions, and invites contemplation, offering a moment of peace in our hectic lives."}
